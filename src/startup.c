//
// The startup function first tries to detect whether deskHPSDR is running
// in its own directory (as usual for compiled-from-the-source installations),
// or whether it is started from a desktop icon and resides in /usr/bin or
// /usr/local/bin.
//
// Only in the latter case, the following steps are taken (this eliminates the
// need for a wrapper startup script):
//
// - create a working directory, if it not yet exists
// - make this the current working directory
// - create files deskhpsdr.stdout and deskhpsdr.stderr there, and connect them
//   with stdout and stderr
//
// The working directory on Linux is $HOME/.config/deskhpsdr, on MacOS it is
// "$HOME/Library/Application Support/deskHPSDR".
//
// If something goes wrong (e.g. the $HOME environment variable does not exist,
// the working directory exists but is not a directory, or cannot be created)
// then $HOME is used as the working dir.
//
// Note no output (via t_print) should be made until either stdout is "reconnected"
// or we know that we won't reconnect it.
//
// This routine is also the right place to set priorities, etc., if the operating
// system allows. For MacOS, we set the "Keep awake" flag.
